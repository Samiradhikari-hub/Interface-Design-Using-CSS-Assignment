            <p class="chorus">Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely</p>
            <p>I have nobody for my own</p>
            <p class="chorus">I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely</p>
            <p>I have nobody for my own</p>
            <p>I am so lonely</p>

            <p>Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man</p>
            <p>Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord</p>
            <p>That's always been there, man</p>
            <p>Like, took all the bullshit</p>
            <p>But then one day, she can't take it no more and decide to leave</p>

            <p>Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night</p>
            <p>And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side</p>
            <p>Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her</p>
            <p>I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride</p>

            <p>Backtracking over these few years</p>
            <p>Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad</p>
            <p>'Cause ever since my girl left me</p>
            <p>My whole life came crashing and I'm so</p>

            <p class="chorus">Lonely (so lonely)</p>
            <p class="chorus">I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)</p>

            <p>Can't believe I had a girl like you</p>
            <p>And I just let you walk right outta my life</p>
            <p>After all I put you through</p>
            <p>You still stuck around and stayed by my side</p>

            <p>What really hurt me is I broke your heart</p>
            <p>Baby, you're a good girl and I had no right</p>
            <p>I really wanna make things right</p>
            <p>'Cause without you in my life girl, I'm so</p>

            <p class="chorus">Lonely (so lonely)</p>

            <p>Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl</p>
            <p>That can take the things that you been through</p>
            <p>Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run</p>
            <p>And I would be out chasing you</p>

            <p>'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be</p>
            <p>Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see</p>
            <p>Than the girl of my dreams that made me be</p>
            <p>So happy but now so lonely</p>

            <p class="chorus">Lonely (so lonely)</p>
            <p class="chorus">I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)</p>

            <p>Never thought that I'd be alone</p>
            <p>I didn't think you'd be gone this long</p>
            <p>I just want you to call my phone</p>
            <p>So stop playing girl and come on home</p>

            <p>Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout</p>
            <p>I want me and you to work it out</p>
            <p>I never wished to ever hurt my baby</p>
            <p>And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so</p>

            <p class="chorus">Lonely (so lonely)</p>
